# Low-code-layout
Low-code website template for your landing page or basic website needs, build in minutes with the template.

#### To be honest, I was brushing my vanilla CSS skills while building a structure for a website.
#### I found this to be interesting fit when you need to build landing page or a photo gallery or basic portfolio or any typical basic website for a client/friend or yourself, without wasting much time building all the bits-&-pieces use this template and just edit out html, colors and effects.

#### It will save ton of precious time and also dealing with responsiveness will not be an headache.
